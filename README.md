# APIs

## Filter
Main API for configuring and changing filter parameters. This API is only
available for logged-in users. Each user can have a number of filters and the
filter id will be an ascending number for the user. So if a user has three
filters they are reachable in:
```
/api/filters/1
/api/filters/2
/api/filters/3
```

The available APIs and commands:

### /api/filters

* **GET** - Get list of available filters and their names
* **POST** - Create new filter. Returns the filter ID

## /api/filters/<id>

* **GET** - Get settings
